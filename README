CHATK - Chat Server+Client System For PJATK Students.

A small chat utility made by and for the students of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Computer Science.

-Usage-

	-For the host-
		Launch the server on some host machine using the 'LaunchServer.bat' script,
		or run 'java Client' in your terminal(make sure you are in the project's directory).

	-For the client-
		Launch the client using the 'LaunchClient.bat script',
		or run 'java Server' in your terminal(make sure you are in the project's directory)

-Arguments-
	
	If you're running this utility from the terminal you can specify the port number
	on which the server will listen and the clients will try to connect.
	If you desire to do that - just provide the port number as the first argument for both Server and Clients.
	Remember: both Server and Clients should have the same port otherwise they won't connect.
	If nothing is provided both Server and Clients will use the default port (9009)
